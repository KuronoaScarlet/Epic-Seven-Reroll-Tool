# Epic Seven Reroll Table
A tool for keeping track of how much you waste rerolling Garo's shop searching for Bookmarks :D

## Instructions
1. You must enter your details about the quantity of each of the currencies shown.
2. Click on the "Set Values" button.
3. Now comes the fun part. The tracker keeps track of both the amount of skystones rerolled and bookmarks purchased.
	  - Add SS Pack: Subtracts 951 SS from the totals and gives you a mark to stop rolling SS. The number subtracted each time is not arbitrary, 950 SS costs the pack that gives you 50 Covenant Bookmarks, and the idea is to compare the profitability between the direct purchase of that pack, and the shop reroll.
	  - Buy and Unbuy: Add the amount of Covenants or Mystics to the table of contents. You must click on them when you buy in-game.
